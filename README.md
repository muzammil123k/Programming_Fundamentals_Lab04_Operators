🚀 Programming Fundamentals - Lab 04
📌 Overview:
This repository contains Lab 04 solutions from the Programming Fundamentals course at FAST NUCES Lahore.
The lab covers arithmetic operators, mathematical expressions, and input/output operations in C++.

📂 Topics Covered
✅ Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, %)
✅ Constants (const keyword)
✅ Mathematical Expressions & Operator Precedence
✅ User Input (cin) & Output (cout)

📝 Lab Tasks
🟢 Task 01 - Arithmetic Operations
Write a program that takes three numbers as input and applies the following operations:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Modulus

📌 Code: Q1.cpp

📌 Example Input:
Enter first number: 20
Enter second number: 4
Enter third number: 5

📌 Expected Output:
Addition: 29
Subtraction: 11
Multiplication: 400
Division: 1
Modulus: 0

🟢 Task 02 - Cylinder Calculations
Write a program that reads the radius and height of a cylinder and calculates:

Perimeter = 2 * π * r
Lateral Surface Area = 2 * π * r * h
Volume = π * r² * h
📌 Code: Q2.cpp

📌 Example Input:
Enter radius: 5
Enter height: 10

📌 Expected Output:

Perimeter: 31.4
Lateral Surface Area: 314.0
Volume: 785.0


🟢 Task 03 - Multiplication Table
Write a program that reads an integer and prints its first 10 multiples.

📌 Code: Q3.cpp

📌 Example Input:
Enter a number: 6

📌 Expected Output:
6
12
18
24
30
36
42
48
54
60

🟢 Task 04 - Car Fuel Efficiency (Miles per Gallon)
A car holds 15 gallons of gasoline and can travel 375 miles before refueling.
Write a program that calculates the miles per gallon (MPG) using:

📌 Formula:
MPG = Miles Driven / Gallons of Gas Used

📌 Code: Q4.cpp

📌 Expected Output:

MPG = 25


🟢 Task 05 - Sum of First & Last Digit
Write a program that inputs a four-digit integer and sums the first and last digit.

📌 Code: i220970_Q5.cpp

📌 Example Input:
Enter a 4-digit number: 4233

📌 Expected Output:
4 + 3 = 7
